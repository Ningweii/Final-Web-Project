# Final-Web-Project

This is a basic java CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) web application. 
It was written in Eclipse EE and it implements Apache Tomcan and MySQL techlonogies.

This web application let's user to register, log in and log out.
It has three main pages: 'login page', 'register page', and 'user page'. 
User page is a protected page. As well as couple other pages. 
Since user page is a protected page, you won't be able to access it directly without logging in. 
Needless to say, in order to log in you'll have to register first.
After the registration, your data (username, password, first name, last name, profession) will be
uploaded on MySQL database and you will be able to access userpage right after registration is complete. 
This web app also provides logout functionality. If you press log out button 
your data will be removed from HttpSession and you'll be redirected to login page.
Unless you log in again all protected pages will be inaccessible to you. 


This little project was created by me as a key requirement for the Java course final exam
